# Studying the Extreme Price Variation of Food Commodities between Markets in Lebanon
The project experimentally investigates the difference in prices of the same basic food items between multiple supermarkets (within and between different regions) in Lebanon. Supermarkets are arbitrarily chosen to compare prices between them, and interviews are conducted with random citizens. In addition, two datasets taken from the World Bank and the World Food Programme Price Database were explored. The results show an irregular and inconsistent presentation of prices that are sensitive towards the exchange rate of the Lebanese pound especially when it is a devaluation. The proposed solution is based on developing a website and an application that not only shows the prices of the Basic Food Basket in well-known supermarkets (GDO - Great Organized Distribution), but also the prices set by the ministry of economy MOE. This proposition is heavily backed by the general director of the ministry Dr. Mohammad Abou Haidar, who will support the development of the website, and the primary field studies. An obstacle appears to exist as the exchange rate in the black market changes instantly while the prices of the ministry are updated on a monthly basis. In the next stage of this project, we will be focusing on solving this problem together with other technical difficulties.
